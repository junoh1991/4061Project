1. How to compile: call make. 'make'

2. How to use the program from the shell:

    ./web_server port path num_dispatch num_workers qlen
    
    port - number can be specified (between 1025 and 65535)
    path - path to your web root location where files are served from
    num_dispatch - number of dispatcher threads to run
    num_workers - number of worker threads to run
    qlen - fixed, bounded length of the request queue

3. The program's description:
    
    The program creates a web server that uses dispatcher threads to receive requests from clients and worker
    threads to complete those requests and send back info to the client (or handle errors). The program can
    handle multiple requests concurrently. A log detailing all of the requests is created while the program runs.

4. Work Distribution:
    We did partner programming for the whole project so the distribution is even.
